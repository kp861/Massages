              Pain can be a huge obstacle for people to exercise<br><br>

              The problem is that pain can be a huge obstacle for people to exercise. Pain can also impact on a person’s ability to do the things in life that they that are important to them such as playing with kids, physical activity, sports, work, socialising and house work. This is turn can impact on a person’s physical and psychological well-being.<br><br>
