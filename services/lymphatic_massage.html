            <div class="container-text"><p><b>Lymphatic drainage massage</b>, also known as manual lymphatic drainage, is a gentle form of massage used to relieve painful swelling in your arms and legs caused by lymphedema. Lymphedema often affects people recovering from breast cancer surgery.<br><br>

              Lymphedema happens when your tissues retain fluid left behind after your cardiovascular system sends blood to your tissues and organs.<br><br>

              The remaining fluid is called lymph. Normally, your lymphatic system collects your lymph and returns it to your heart via a network of lymph vessels and lymph nodes. When something disrupts your lymphatic system's process, lymph collects in your arms and legs, making them swell.<br><br>

              A massage therapist uses lymphatic drainage massage techniques to move lymph from your tissues to your lymph nodes, which eases the swelling in your tissues.<br><br>

              Healthcare providers are still studying whether lymphatic drainage massages make a difference. Some studies show people age 60 and below benefitted by having lymphatic drainage massages.<br><br>

              Lymphatic drainage massages are often used to relieve lymphedema following breast cancer surgery. Other conditions that benefit from lymphatic drainage massages are:<br><br>

              <li><b>Rheumatoid arthritis</b>: This is ongoing arthritis in your joints causing joint pain, swelling and stiffness.</li>
              <li><b>Fibromyalgia</b>: This condition causes chronic muscle and joint pain.</li>
              <li><b>Chronic venous insufficiency</b>: This happens when your leg veins aren't working effectively, making it hard for your blood to return to your heart from your legs.</li>
              <li><b>Lipedema</b>: This happens when excess fat accumulates in your lower body, blocking your lymphatic pathway and causing lymphedema.</li>
