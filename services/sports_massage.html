            <div class="container-text"><p>During a <b>sports massage</b> the musculoskeletal system (muscles, tendons and ligaments) is manipulated using hands-on techniques in order to improve its efficiency.<br><br>

              Sports massage is proven to release and reduce tension in muscles, improve circulation and encourage the removal of waste products such as lactic acid during high intensity activity and can help to relax the body. All of this helps promote recovery and reduces the chance of muscle injury. Those who are prone to overuse injuries often benefit from sports massage in between training sessions, as the muscles are allowed to relax and recover fully before the next session. In addition to the physical benefits, sports massage can help an athlete to mentally prepare for their activity or competition.<br><br>

              If you are returning to a sport following injury, sports massage can aid in the rehabilitation process, it can speed healing and reduce discomfort. The techniques used in sports massage can be effective for both acute and chronic injuries.<br><br>

              Sports massage is an excellent way to encourage fast recovery and assist in injury prevention. However if you have sustained an injury that is preventing you form participating in the sport that you love, or you are struggling to perform at your best due to a series of “niggles”, we would recommend that you book an appointment for a physio assessment and treatment which can address problems in more detail.</p></div>
