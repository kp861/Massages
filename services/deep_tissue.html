But that’s only part of the story: a good treatment can help you feel great from head to toe, inside and out.</p><br>
              <p><b>Stress relief</b><br>
              Deep tissue massages help reduce stress in two ways: they stimulate the release of hormones that naturally relax the body, and they’re also a good opportunity to unwind in a quiet, peaceful environment.<br><br>

              <b>Pain reduction</b><br>
              Chronic pain is relieved by deep tissue massage treatment, as it releases the underlying tension within the muscles, particularly in the neck and back; massages can in some cases be more effective than medical intervention in these areas.<br><br>

              <b>Lower blood pressure and heart rate</b><br>
              The reduced tension that deep tissue massage provides leads to a natural reduction in blood pressure, also leading to a reduction in heart rate.<br><br>

              <b>Breaking up scar tissue & easier movement</b><br>
              Improved circulation means that deep tissue massages can ease the localised stiffness and pain that can often affect scar tissue, and ensure that movement isn’t as badly restricted in that particular area.<br><br>

              <b>Reduced arthritis symptoms</b><br>
              All of the above benefits can be transformative for arthritis sufferers: less tension, relieved pain, ease of movement (especially in joints), and as a result, improved sleep patterns.<br><br>

              <b>Rehabilitate injured muscles</b><br>
              Deep tissue massages stretch out muscles to their fullest extent, removing any tightness from them, and also releasing the toxins that can weigh them down and make them feel tired.</p></div>
